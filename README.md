# Zoe Gaidmore's Personal Website

This is a personal website created as a project for CSE 134B: Web Client Languages at UC San Diego. The site is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and is designed to showcase both technical skills and personal background.

The website includes information about my interests and education, along with interactive project cards that dynamically load content from a `.json` file — either locally or from a remote source — demonstrating my ability to work with data fetching and DOM manipulation in JavaScript.
